  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p class="first-paragraph">The first blog was created in 1994 by Justin Hall. It was called Links.net, and it consisted of a series of links to other websites that Hall found interesting.</p>
  <p>The term "weblog" was coined by Jorn Barger in 1997. He defined it as "a frequently updated personal journal on the World Wide Web."</p>
  <p>The short form, "blog", was coined by Peter Merholz in 1999. He jokingly broke the word "weblog" into the phrase "we blog".</p>
  <p>The popularity of blogging exploded in the early 2000s. This was due to a number of factors, including the rise of social media, the increasing availability of broadband internet, and the development of easy-to-use blogging platforms.</p>
